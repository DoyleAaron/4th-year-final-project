    "## Points Prediction \n",
    "- The aim of this model is to try and be able to predict the amount of points a player will score in an upcoming gameweek.\n",
    "- I want to see if it's possible to get all the players individual game data for the season to train my model as training it on a game by game basis will be much more accurate than over the space of a whole season I think.\n",
    "- For this I am going to build a seperate python script which can be found in individual/player-data.py\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Research & Obtaining Data\n",
    "- I need to try and find a good way to measure this prediction as there isn't a specific target value\n",
    "- My initial plan was to base it by doing just points but I don't want to do this as thinking about it more, it would just be a total season points tally divided by the amount of games played leaving you with the same amount of points predicted for every week\n",
    "- I would like to include fixture difficulty in some aspect based off of the formula I created in my fixture analyser\n",
    "- My current Idea is to see if I can automate going through each players individual FBREF page and getting their game by game statistics, this would give me a much more accurate model as it would actually be basing the model off of a game by game basis rather than the whole season.\n",
    "- I am going to try this with all of the 24/25 seasons data so far and see if I can make a python script to go through them and retrieve all of the stats.\n",
    "- I was able to get the first player fine, but they have unique ids in the url which is an issue for automating this process\n",
    "- I then tried to use an external api that I found here: https://natstat.com/fc\n",
    "- Unfortunately this was also a dead end as it didn't have nearly enough in depth stats that I need to build this model\n",
    "- I eventually found a way around the 429 error (too many requests), I had to put a delay of 11 to 15 seconds in between each request, this is to make it seem more natural and so their servers don't shut me out.\n",
    "- Getting this data took me about 2/3 hours and then I realised I didn't have the player name in the data which was a big part of this for me.\n",
    "- So I had to run it again and make sure that I was appending the CSV with the players ID from the site and their name so that I can accurately train the model.\n",
    "- I will have to import goalkeepers seperately as they have a different set of statistics than other players.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pre-Processing & Cleansing Data\n",
    "- There is going to be a lot of data pre processing and cleansing here as the scraped data is currently extremely messy\n",
    "- A checklist of what needs to be done to the data is as follows:\n",
    "    1. Remove games where players didn't play\n",
    "    2. Remove blank rows\n",
    "    3. Add headers to the columns\n",
    "    4. Filter for only Premier League games\n",
    "    5. Remove unneeded columns.\n",
    "    6. Add a fantasy points column"
