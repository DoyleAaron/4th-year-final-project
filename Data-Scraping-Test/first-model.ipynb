    "I had a lot of difficulty extracting this table from the initial code that was on the site, my original plan was to take it directly from the site but my code couldn't pick up the table that I needed to extract for my statistics. So then I tried extracting it to a local HTML file and this is where I started to find out more. I then began trying to extract my desired table from the HTML file that I had created but once again this was unable to pick up the table that I needed, I began reading through the raw HTML code of the site near where my desired table was when I eventually spotted this sign '<--' 2 lines above the table. This got me wondering as I recognised it as a comment symbol and I googled it and realised that comments aren't picked up in the search method I was using so I deleted this line in the local HTML file and ran my code again and the data extracted into my CSV so that I can pre proccess it and begin to build my model."
